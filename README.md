# realtime_YAMNET
Simple real-time Sound Event Detector based on [YAMNET](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/yamnet) and pyaudio.  
This is a toy project for SED, which you can analyze sound events with your own laptop mic in every second.  
The system shows the top five among the 521 target events.  

```
python realtime_YAMNET.py
